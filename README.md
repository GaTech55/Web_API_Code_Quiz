## Description

This website was created to test a user's knowledge of Web API Code. When the quiz is started the timer should count down and for each incorrect answer be subtracted by 15 seconds (this was changed from 10 to 15 due to the gif being incorrect). At the end of the quiz the user is given the option to enter their credentials so that their highscore can be saved on another page. This is the expected outcome.
